# FXBitcoinTracker
Bitcoin index price tracker using Java FX and coindesk API.

This project is intended to be a educational project using constantly learned 
features and structures from Java FX and/or Java world.

This repo is still under development and will be constantly updated as soon as I correct things
 / learn something new that can be included in this example.

The API used to retrieve Bitcoin index price history
 is [Powered by CoinDesk](http://www.coindesk.com/price/).
